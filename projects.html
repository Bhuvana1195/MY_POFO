        <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Heart is the most important organ in a human body. It is made of Cardio vascular tissues that do not fatigue.
             The heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaker cells. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the most common cause of death globally as of 2008 accounting for 30% of deaths. 
             Of these three-quarters are the result of coronary artery disease and Stroke. 
            It is also determined that Machine learning helps in predicting these diseases beforehand and reduce the 
            mortality rate caused due to non-timely identification of the symptoms of cardiovascular diseases.
